HVAC Distribution
#################

.. contents:: Table of Contents

In HPXML multiple ``HVACDistribution`` elements can be associated with a heating
or cooling system. For the purposes of this translator, it is required that only one ``HVACDistribution`` element be linked.
That element can then describe a ducted system, a hydronic
system, or an open ended other system. For the translation to HEScore, only
``HVACDistribution`` elements that are ducted are considered.

Duct Location Mapping
*********************

For each ``Ducts`` element in each air distribution system, the location of the
duct mapped from HPXML enumerations to HEScore enumerations according to the
following mapping.

.. warning:: 

   If an HPXML duct location maps to *not translated* above, the 
   translation for the house will fail.

Duct Fractions
**************

For each ``Ducts`` element in an air distribution system the ``FracDuctArea`` is summed by
HEScore :ref:`duct location <ductlocationmapping>`.

Duct Insulation
***************

If the any of the ``Ducts`` elements in a particular
:ref:`location <ductlocationmapping>` have a ``DuctInsulationRValue`` or
``DuctInsulationThickness`` that is greater than zero or have a ``DuctInsulationMaterial`` that is not ``None``, 
all of the ducts in that location are considered insulated.

Duct Sealing
************

Duct leakage measurements are not stored on the individual ``Ducts`` elements in
HEScore, which means they are not directly associated with a duct location.
They are instead associated with an ``AirDistribution`` element, which can have
many ducts in many locations. Duct sealing information is therefore associated
with all ducts in an ``AirDistribution`` element.

To specify that the ducts in an ``AirDistribution`` system are sealed, the
translator expects to find either of the following elements:

* ``DuctLeakageMeasurement/LeakinessObservedVisualInspection`` element with
  the value of "connections sealed w mastic".
* ``HVACDistribution/HVACDistributionImprovement/DuctSystemSealed`` element
  with the value of "true".

The ``DuctLeakageMeasurement`` can hold values for actual measurements of
leakage, but since HEScore cannot do anything with them, they will be ignored.
Therefore the following will result in an "unsealed" designation:

.. code-block:: xml

   <DuctLeakageMeasurement>
      <DuctType>supply</DuctType>
      <!-- All of this is ignored -->
      <DuctLeakageTestMethod>duct leakage tester</DuctLeakageTestMethod>
      <DuctLeakage>
          <Units>CFM25</Units>
          <Value>0.000000001</Value><!-- exceptionally low leakage -->
      </DuctLeakage>
   </DuctLeakageMeasurement>

and the following will result in a "sealed" designation:

.. code-block:: xml
   :emphasize-lines: 3

   <DuctLeakageMeasurement>
      <DuctType>supply</DuctType>
      <LeakinessObservedVisualInspection>connections sealed w mastic</LeakinessObservedVisualInspection>
   </DuctLeakageMeasurement>
