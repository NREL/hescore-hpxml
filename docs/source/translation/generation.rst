HEScore allows for a single photovoltaic system to be included as of v2016. In
HPXML, multiple ``PVSystem`` elements can be specified to represent the PV
systems on the house. The translator combines multiple systems and generates the
appropriate HEScore inputs as follows:

Capacity Known
==============

If each ``PVSystem`` has a ``MaxPowerOutput``, this is true. If each
``PVSystem`` has a ``NumberOfPanels`` or if each has ``CollectorArea``, this is
false. Preference is given to known capacity if available. Either a
``MaxPowerOutput`` must be specified for every ``PVSystem`` or ``CollectorArea``
must be specified for every ``PVSystem``.

DC Capacity
===========

If each ``PVSystem`` has a ``MaxPowerOutput``, the system capacity is known. The
``system_capacity`` in HEScore is calculated by summing all the
``MaxPowerOutput`` elements in HPXML.

.. _number-of-panels:

Number of Panels
================

If ``MaxPowerOutput`` is missing from any ``PVSystem``, the translator will
check to see if every system has ``NumberOfPanels`` and calculate the total
number of panels. 

If ``NumberOfPanels`` isn't available on every system, the translator will look
for ``CollectorArea`` on every PVSystem. The number of panels is calculated by
summing all the collector area, dividing by 17.6 sq.ft., and rounding to the
nearest whole number.

Weighted Averages
=================

The below quantities are calculated using weighted averages. The weights used
are in priority order:

- ``MaxPowerOutput``
- ``NumberOfPanels``
- ``CollectorArea``

Which is the same data elements used to determine the PV sizing inputs above.

Year Installed
==============

For each ``PVSystem`` the ``YearInverterManufactured`` and
``YearModulesManufactured`` element values are retrieved, and the greater of the
two is assumed to be the year that system was installed. When there are multiple
``PVSystem`` elements, a weighted average is calculated and used.

Panel Orientation (Azimuth)
===========================

For each ``PVSystem`` the ``ArrayAzimuth`` (degrees clockwise from north) is
retrieved. If ``ArrayAzimuth`` is not available, ``ArrayOrientation`` (north,
northwest, etc) is converted into an azimuth. A weighted average azimuth is
calculated and converted into the nearest cardinal direction (north, northwest,
etc) for submission into the ``array_azimuth`` HEScore input (which expects a
direction, not a numeric azimuth).

.. _panel-tilt:

Panel Tilt
==========

For each ``PVSystem`` the ``ArrayTilt`` (in degrees from horizontal) is
retrieved. A weighted average tilt is calculated and submitted to the
``array_tilt`` HEScore input (which expects an enumeration, not a numeric tilt).
The tilt is mapped to HEScore as follows:
